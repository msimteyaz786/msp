                <p>Java is an Object-oriented Programming language developed by <b> James Gosling</b> at <b>Sun Microsystem </b> in <b>1995. </b><br><br>

                    Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, 
robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.  <br><br>

                Java is a platform independent language. Java programs do not access the operating system directly. The name 'Java' is taken form a list of random words and is based on the famous cofee bean of Java Island.<br><br> Java is not an acronym for "Just Another Vague Acronym." <br><br> On 23 May 1995 the Java enviroment was announced by sun Microsystems.<br><br> The main purpose for developing java language is to control consumer electronics devices. <br><br> When the firsrt version of Java was released, the entire Java team numbered less than 30 people.
                    Java was started as a project called 'Oak' by James Gosling in June 1991, Gosling's goals were to implement a Virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. <br><br>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><b>Android Apps:</b><br>
                Android apps are developed in Java Language. All the Android apps, the code is written is basically in Java Language. Even the latest Android app maker Kotlin Programmign Language is inspired by Java.<br><br>
                <b>Software Development IDEs:</b><br>
                Java is used to develop many IDEs that are helpful to development of these softwares. Some of the IDEs based on java are Eclipse, intelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans IDE etc. <br><br>
                <b>Big Data Technolies:</b><br>
                Java gives you access to tons of tried-and-tested libraries, debuggers and monitoring tools. Hadoop is written in Java.<br><br>
                <b>Web Application:</b><br>
                Java is widely used in E-Commerce and web Application space. Many governments, healthcare, insurance, education, defense, and several other departments have their web application built in Java.<br><br> 
                <b>Scientific Application:</b><br>
                Java is wide used in Scientific applications. Some of the main domains where java used are : Natural Language Processing and AI.<br><br>
                <b>J2ME Applications:</b><br>
                J2ME i.e. java Micro Edition is very popular ans used in products like Blu-ray, Card-chip programming Set-top boxes, etc.<br><br>
